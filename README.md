# Amazon Review Bias – Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This project explores Amazon product review data to evaluate whether ratings are influenced by
price, discount percentage, or review volume.

## Dataset
Kaggle Amazon Sales Dataset containing product details, pricing, discounts, and customer reviews.

## Key Findings
- Product ratings are highly concentrated between 4.0–4.3 regardless of price or discount.
- Correlation analysis shows weak relationships between rating and pricing variables.
- Products with more reviews exhibit lower rating variance, consistent with statistical convergence.
- Results suggest strong selection bias in online marketplace reviews.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning with pandas (regex, type coercion)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Statistical reasoning and correlation analysis
- Data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn

## Tools
Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn
